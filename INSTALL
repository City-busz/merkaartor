Prerequisites:
==============

 * Working C++ compiler
 * Qt 4.4.0 or later development environment (for Qt 5.x.y, use qt5 branch)
 * Proj.4
 * GDAL

On (K)ubuntu Edgy it is sufficient to install the qt4-dev package
to satisfy these requirements.

Instructions:
=============

0. Get the sources, either tarball or git:

$ git clone git@github.com:openstreetmap/merkaartor.git

 !  By default, this is the latest development version. If you want to use an older
 !  one, you have to checkout the commit/tag:
 !  
 !  $ git checkout 0.17.0
 !  
 !  Please, use this only for testing (for example, if some feature does not
 !  work, but it did in older release and you want to check which one), never
 !  report bugs for older versions.

1. Change directory to the one in which you unpacked Merkaartor

For example
$ cd /home/me/src/Merkaartor-0.xx

2. Run qmake

$ qmake

Note that you need the Qt4 version of qmake - running the Qt3 version
will generate incorrect makefiles.  If both are installed, take care
to run the correct version.  For example, on Fedora run

$ qmake-qt4

and on (K)ubuntu run

$ /usr/share/qt4/bin/qmake

2.1 Other qmake parameters for Merkaartor.pro

PREFIX=<path>               - base prefix for installation (unix only)
TRANSDIR_MERKAARTOR=<path>  - where will the Merkaartor translations be installed
TRANSDIR_SYSTEM=<path>      - where your global Qt translation directory is
NODEBUG=1                   - release target
NOUSEWEBKIT                 - disable use of WebKit (Yahoo adapter)
SYSTEM_QTSA                 - use system copy of qtsingleapplication instead of internal
SYSTEM_QUAZIP               - use system copy of quazip instead of internal


3. Run your build tool, make for posix like systems, nmake for
Windows C++ Build system

$ make
or
$ nmake

4. If you are lucky, you'll find an executable in the binaries subdirectory.
Otherwise, check our github page [1], especially check the issues and possibly
report yours.
