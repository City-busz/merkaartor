Prerequisites:
==============

 * Working C++ compiler
 * Qt 4.4.0 or later development environment (for Qt 5.x.y, use qt5 branch)
 * Proj.4
 * GDAL

On (K)ubuntu Edgy it is sufficient to install the qt4-dev package
to satisfy these requirements.


Windows (32bit)
---------------

Not tested recently. Try the same as in 64bit case, just use the 32bit packages instead:

$ pacman -S base-devel \
	msys/git \
	mingw32/mingw-w32-i686-qt5 \
	mingw32/mingw-w32-i686-gdal \
	mingw32/mingw-w32-i686-proj \
	mingw32/mingw-w32-i686-openjpeg2 \
	mingw32/mingw-w32-i686-json-c

Windows (64bit)
---------------

On Windows, download MSYS2, run the mingw64 shell install the dependencies with
(it seems openjpeg and json-c is also needed, but not installed correctly by
their users):

$ pacman -S base-devel \
	msys/git \
	mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 \
	mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gdal \
	mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-proj \
	mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-openjpeg2 \
	mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-json-c


Instructions:
=============

0. Get the sources, either tarball or git:

$ git clone git@github.com:openstreetmap/merkaartor.git

 !  By default, this is the latest development version. If you want to use an older
 !  one, you have to checkout the commit/tag:
 !  
 !  $ git checkout 0.17.0
 !  
 !  Please, use this only for testing (for example, if some feature does not
 !  work, but it did in older release and you want to check which one), never
 !  report bugs for older versions.

1. Change directory to the one in which you unpacked Merkaartor

For example
$ cd /home/me/src/Merkaartor-0.xx

2. Run qmake

$ qmake

Note that you need the Qt4 version of qmake - running the Qt3 version
will generate incorrect makefiles.  If both are installed, take care
to run the correct version.  For example, on Fedora run

$ qmake-qt4

and on (K)ubuntu run

$ /usr/share/qt4/bin/qmake

2.1 Other qmake parameters for Merkaartor.pro

PREFIX=<path>               - base prefix for installation (unix only)
TRANSDIR_MERKAARTOR=<path>  - where will the Merkaartor translations be installed
TRANSDIR_SYSTEM=<path>      - where your global Qt translation directory is
NODEBUG=1                   - release target
NOUSEWEBKIT                 - disable use of WebKit (Yahoo adapter)
SYSTEM_QTSA                 - use system copy of qtsingleapplication instead of internal
SYSTEM_QUAZIP               - use system copy of quazip instead of internal


3. Run your build tool, make for posix like systems (including MSYS2), nmake for
Windows C++ Build system

$ make release
or
$ nmake release

Substitute release with debug, if you want to debug the code or report bugs.

4. If you are lucky, you'll find an executable in the binaries subdirectory.
Otherwise, check our github page [1], especially check the issues and possibly
report yours.
